#Telecom churn prediction using machine learning 


Churn models aim to identify early churn signals and recognize customers with an increased likelihood to leave voluntarily. Many machine learning algorithms are used to tackle the churning prediction problem. These methods include: Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees learning, Regression Analysis, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Sequential Pattern Mining and Market Basket Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Rough Set Approach.
